# Note Taker
In this project I modified starter code to create an application that can be used to write and save notes. The purpose of this project is to highlight the use of: middleware, routes and express. Along with this I deployed this application through the use heroku.

## Technologies Used
* Express.js 
* JSON
* Node.js
* JavaScript
* uuid package
* nodemon package
  
## Criteria that I Met to Achieve this

* When the user opens the application they are taken to a landing page with a link to a notes page.
* When the user clicks on the link to the notes page they are presented with a page with existing notes and an empty field to enter a new note title and the note’s text.
* When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, a Save icon appears in the navigation bar.
* When the user clicks on the Save icon the new note entered is saved and appears in the existing notes section.
* When the user click on an existing note then the note appears in the section where new notes are written.
* When the user click on the Write icon in the navigation bar presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text.
